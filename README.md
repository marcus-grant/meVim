=====

*My personal configurations for NeoVim, which by contrast to my vanilla vim config is a fully featured IDE for Python, Javascript, C++, Platform IO, Shell, Rust & Go*

Keymaps
-------

* Leader: `,`
  * `<leader>l`: Toggle `vim-javascript` concealing features
* Pane Controls


Folding
-------

- Here's a good place to go over how to change settings based on filetype
  - This snippet sets `foldmethod=marker` based on filetypes
  - `autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile   *.c,*.h,*.java set noic cin noexpandtab`




Markdown Editing
----------------
### Vim Markdown Composer
A plugin that uses the Rust framework **Aurelius** to live-render markdown into a local server. It requires rust install, which can be done by entering this command into the command line, `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`. Then it's installed into this configuration by entering into the `init.vim` file, this snippet of code below.
```viml
function! BuildComposer(info)
  if a:info.status != 'unchanged' || a:info.force
    if has('nvim')
      !cargo build --release
    else
      !cargo build --release --no-default-features --features json-rpc
    endif
  endif
endfunction

Plug 'euclio/vim-markdown-composer', { 'do': function('BuildComposer') }
```

There are various configurations that are unfortunately only written down into the help file, which is accessible from the vim command, `help markdown-composer`. The default local route to this page is [`http://[::1]:40447/`](http://[::1]:40447/)

#### Markdown Composer Options
* `g:markdown_composer_browser`: Specifies a browser for the plugin to use, if not specified, it will use the default.
* `g:markdown_composer_open_browser`: If set to `0`, then the plugin won't attempt to open the user's specified browser, requiring the user to open it to the local address manually
* `g:markdown_composer_external_renderer`: This allows an external command to be run by the server to render.
  * It does so by sending out text through **stdout** into the command, then back using **stdin**
  * Since doing this externally is slower than with the regular renderer, refresh rates might need to be altered
  * Ex: `let g:markdown_composer_external_renderer='pandoc -f markdown -t html'`
    * This uses the infamous `pandoc` to handle external rendering
* `g:markdown_composer_refresh_rate`: The rate in ms that new markdown should be sent from the buffer to the server, defaults *(0)* to every keystroke
* `g:markdown_composer_syntax_theme`: The theme that gets used to render code blocks with syntax highlighting
  * More info [here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/)
  * Variable should be set by the CSS file's path minus the `*.css` extension
  * The default is Github's style
* `g:markdown_composer_autostart`: Whether the server should start automatically whenever a markdown buffer is opened
  * Defaults to `1`, ie yes
* `g:markdown_composer_custom_css`: A list of custom CSS URIs that should be loaded instead of the Github Styles
  * Can be local paths and URLs
  * **NOTE** they **must** use absolute and prefixed schemes like so: `file:///home/euclio/markdown.css`

Javascript
----------
### `Vim-Javascript`
* There are **concealing** features embedded that can make code look nice, but crucially make code shorter when editing in neovim
* Below is an example config that is currently placed in `plugins.vim`

```viml
set conceallevel=1
map <leader>l :exec &conceallevel ? "set conceallevel=0" : "set conceallevel=1"<CR>
let g:javascript_conceal_function             = "ƒ"
let g:javascript_conceal_null                 = "ø"
let g:javascript_conceal_this                 = "@"
let g:javascript_conceal_return               = "⇚"
let g:javascript_conceal_undefined            = "¿"
let g:javascript_conceal_NaN                  = "ℕ"
let g:javascript_conceal_prototype            = "¶"
let g:javascript_conceal_static               = "•"
let g:javascript_conceal_super                = "Ω"
let g:javascript_conceal_arrow_function       = "⇒"
let g:javascript_conceal_noarg_arrow_function = "⇒"
let g:javascript_conceal_underscore_arrow_function = "⇒"
```
* On top of setting concealing characters, it turns concealing on with `set conceallevel=1`
* Then there's a keymap that toggles JS concealment `<leader>l`
